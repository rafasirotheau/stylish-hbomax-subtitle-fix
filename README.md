## Requirements
- [UserCSS](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS) compatible userstyle manager. ![image](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/raw/master/images/icon/16.png) [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) is recommended.


## How to use
There are a few options:
- If you have ![image](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/raw/master/images/icon/16.png) [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) installed, just click in the badge at the top of this README.
- Access any of the [urls from the link section](#links), and install the userstyle from there.
- Create a new style in your usertyle manager, using the [UserCSS code](https://github.com/rafasirotheau/stylish-hbomax-subtitle-fix/blob/main/hbomax-center-subtitle-fix.user.css) directly from this repository.

If having any trouble on how to use, check the help page of the chosen manager to understand how to install userstyles.
